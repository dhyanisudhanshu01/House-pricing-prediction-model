🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes using Machine Learning techniques.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

Real estate pricing depends on many factors. In this project, I:

Cleaned and prepared housing data

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Built a regression model to predict house prices

Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

This project is part of my learning journey in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence.
